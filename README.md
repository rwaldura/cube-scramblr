# cube-scramblr
Rubik's cube program for Lego Mindstorms EV3
based off [David Gilday's MindCub3r](https://www.mindcuber.com/mindcub3r/mindcub3r.html).

Written in [MicroPython, running on ev3dev](https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3).

If these links have become stale, and you're unable to locate the essential files (structure build file, 
MicroPython manual, and SD card image for EV3), you may try to contact me for backup copies.
